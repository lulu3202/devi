### Face Mask Detection Using Computer Vision and Keras 

This project builds a model to detect whether individuals are wearing masks using Keras and computer vision techniques. A folder-based dataset with masked and unmasked faces is processed by leveraging transfer learning from MobileNetV2 model (a popular CNN used for vision tasks). The model is trained by cropping faces, converting them into numerical formats, and making predictions. The best-performing model is saved as an .h5 file for deployment.

### Airflow ETL Pipeline with Postgres and NASA API Integration

This project creates an ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow to extract data from NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API. The extracted data is transformed and loaded into a PostgreSQL database for further analysis. Airflow orchestrates the workflow, managing task dependencies and scheduling. Docker is used to run Airflow and Postgres in isolated containers. The pipeline automates the daily extraction, transformation, and loading of astronomy-related data.

### Animated Movie Poster Design App

This project utilizes AWS Lambda and the Stability AI Stable Diffusion model from AWS Bedrock to generate animated movie posters based on user-provided text prompts. The generated images are stored in an S3 bucket, and a pre-signed URL is returned for easy access. The implementation includes setting up an API Gateway for user interaction and testing with Postman for seamless functionality.
