### Face Mask Detection Using Computer Vision and Keras 

This project builds a model to detect whether individuals are wearing masks using Keras and computer vision techniques. A folder-based dataset with masked and unmasked faces is processed by leveraging transfer learning from MobileNetV2 model (a popular CNN used for vision tasks). The model is trained by cropping faces, converting them into numerical formats, and making predictions. The best-performing model is saved as an .h5 file for deployment.

### NASA NEO Dataset: Predicting Hazardous Near-Earth Objects with Machine Learning!

This  project utilizes the NASA NEO dataset to predict whether near-Earth objects are hazardous. With 338,199 observations and 9 features, I applied supervised learning techniques, preprocessing the data to optimize inputs. Random Forest emerged as the best-performing algorithm, achieving an accuracy of 91% in classifying hazardous objects.

### Photo critique app

This project develops a Photo Critique App using Streamlit and Google's Gemini-1.5-Flash-8B model. It involves setting up a virtual environment, securely storing API keys, and configuring the app to interact with the Gemini model for generating critiques based on uploaded images. The Streamlit interface allows users to run and test different versions of the app seamlessly.

### Animated Movie Poster Design App

This project utilizes AWS Lambda and the Stability AI Stable Diffusion model from AWS Bedrock to generate animated movie posters based on user-provided text prompts. The generated images are stored in an S3 bucket, and a pre-signed URL is returned for easy access. The implementation includes setting up an API Gateway for user interaction and testing with Postman for seamless functionality.
